I promised my wife that I'd help teach her how to program, and despite my protests and suggestions for easier first projects (she hasn't even done a 'Hello World'), she wanted to make a flashcard app.

I hastily threw together an Activity and a package to connect to a server, as well as some skeleton code for her to fill in (that I admittedly put next to zero thought into). Needless to say, it was all a bit too much for her first project.

So here we are now, with an unfinished, rather sloppy flashcard app that she doesn't want to work on anymore.
I will be taking over, since I'd still like for her to get her app. In doing so, I also plan on making it a bit more robust to lifecycle changes, etc. Additionally, I expect I'll also change how I do the network stuff.


Basically, I'll be changing almost everything about this app, while trying my best to ensure everything acts the way she wants it to (she will be the main user of it, after all). Except the graphics, those will always be ugly as sin, and she'll have to live with it.






But it's all for my wife, so it's worth it.
